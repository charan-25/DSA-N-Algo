/*Table: ActorDirector

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.


Write a solution to find all the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.



Example 1:

Input:
ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
