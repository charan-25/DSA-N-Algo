package Array;
/*There is a biker going on a road trip. The road trip consists of n + 1 points at different altitudes. The biker starts his trip on point 0 with altitude equal 0.

You are given an integer array gain of length n where gain[i] is the net gain in altitude between points i​​​​​​ and i + 1 for all (0 <= i < n). Return the highest altitude of a point.



Example 1:

Input: gain = [-5,1,5,0,-7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-5,-4,1,1,-6]. The highest is 1.
Example 2:

Input: gain = [-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The altitudes are [0,-4,-7,-9,-10,-6,-3,-1]. The highest is 0.


Constraints:

n == gain.length
1 <= n <= 100
-100 <= gain[i] <= 100*/

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] gain = {-4,-3,-2,-1,4,3,2};
        System.out.println(largestAltitude(gain));

        int max =0,n=gain.length;

            pf[i] = pf[i-1] + gain[i-1];
            max = Math.max(pf[i],max);
        }

        return max;
